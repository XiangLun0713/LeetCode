My solutions for LeetCode problems.

## About me
Hi! I am currently a first-year student studying at the University of Malaya. I love problem-solving! But since I'm just starting to dip my toe in programming, some of my solutions isn't the best and are restricted to Java only. But I will keep on improving my LeetCode solutions in this repository, don't you worry ( •̀ .̫ •́ )✧
